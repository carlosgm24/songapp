# songapp

This is the Hangar recuitment test for Carlos Enrique Gamboa Monge, it was done using AngularJS, Boostrap, Sass and json-server as a small server.
I recommend using this chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) to run the project locally.

Before starting:
* Run 'npm install' in the project root.
* Initialize the json-server with json-server --watch db/songs.json in the project root.
* Open the project with the extension or with any other method of preference.
