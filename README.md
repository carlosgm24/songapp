This is the Hangar recuitment test for Carlos Enrique Gamboa Monge, it was done using AngularJS, Boostrap, Sass and json-server as a small server.
* I recommend using this chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) to run the project locally.
* Remember to run 'npm install' in the project root before running it.
